The King beneath the mountains
The King of carven stone
The lord of silver fountains
Shall come into his own
His crown shall be upholden
His harp shall be restrung
His halls shall echo golden
To songs of yore re-sung
The woods shall wave on mountains
And grass beneath the sun
His wealth shall flow in fountains
And the rivers golden run
The streams shall run in gladness,
The lakes shall shine and burn
All sorrow fail and sadness
At the Mountain-king's return
